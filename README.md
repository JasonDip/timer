# Countdown Timer

Create timers in a Timer page then select one to begin counting down. The Countdown page has a view for the active timer, but does not need to be in focus to countdown.

Custom timers can be created and are saved between session in local storage.

The History page keeps a timeline of timers that have started, stopped, or finished.

# Stopwatch Timer

A simple stopwatch that counts up time.

# Adjustable Settings

The settings page allows you to change general settings and sound settings. The general settings are where you set which timer (countdown or stopwatch) to show in the tab title. The sound settings are where you can adjust the sound that plays when a countdown timer has finished.
